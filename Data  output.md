##### Pull info into excel?

+ Is there a reason that we pull to excel then make the HTML
	+ FALSE, The data I was working on is from access DB to html

##### Set it up as a XML output?
+ With XSL2, something I wanted to do for the date-math stuff, We cannot just use the browser.

##### Run the index page on the floor? 
The current plan is to use the extension [Web server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)

(Plan I think still should be to make a site to pull this in a up to the second sort of way)
+ As it is set now we will still need to export the info to a folder (as we do with the HTML)
+ Are we still maybe thinking SharePoint?
+ We could find a quick and dirty way
	+ LiveServer? Node? Turn down some security on the browsers on the floor?

	+ [This might be the way to go](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related)
+ Do we have web server space?
+ We have a site can we use that?
